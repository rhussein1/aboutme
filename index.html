        <p> Who is Reem? </p>
        <p> I am actually a cat in disguise. Disguising as a human was the only way that Girls Who Code would accept me into the program. My interests include being a cat, eating food, watching Netflix, and trying to code with my little cat hands. People don't usually believe it when I tell them I'm a cat, but it's okay. I also enjoy tea, playing old video games, and long walks on the beach. </p>
        <p>I attend Chicago Academy High School in my human alter ego. There, I am a part of several organizations and play softball. I hold positions on the Student Council, which is my stepping stone to make cats the dominante race on Earth. I am also part of the Student in Action, the biggest leadership group in the city, allowing for my training as a dictator to continue. My acceptance to the University of Chicago will secure the ruling of cats and will crush the Earthlings.</p>
        <p>To go to college, my incredibly intelligent cat brain has hatched a plan: attend the Girls Who Code Immersion Program, be a Chicago Scholar, and use my wits to charm the whiskers of the college admissions board (they also happen to be cats).
